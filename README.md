- Hi, I’m Anil Thapa
- I want to be a Machine Learning Engineer.
- I’m currently learning reinforcement learning
- Here are a couple of projects that I would love to show:
  -   Convolutional CNN - A deep convolutional Neural Network
  -   RNN for Time Series - For predicting time series
  -   Apache Spark - For Streaming
  -   Reinforcement Learning - training an Atari Model
- Nothing much here, just on the early learning phase.
