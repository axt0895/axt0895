- Hi, I’m Anil Thapa
- I’m interested in machine learning, deep learning, & reinforcement learning
- I’m currently learning reinforcement learning
- Here are a couple of projects that I would love to show:
-   Convolutional CNN - A deep convolutional Neural Network
-   RNN for Time Series - For predicting time series
-   Apache Spark - For Streaming
-   Reinforcement Learning - training an Atari Model
- Nothing much here, just on the early learning phase.
